<i>Skinned Up Knee 1972</i> contains related works, partly physically and technologically interconnected, partly only ideally.
Time, stopped, ever flowing or controlled by the viewers' action plays an integral role in all of them. The most prominent work is <i>Olympic Strampler,</i>
an old fitness bike for visitors to ride and to control the playback of rain footage on two mid-2000s flatscreens. Then, there's 
<i>Perpetual das Vesper,</i> an immersion heater equipped with periphery to sustain light boiling indefinitely, supplied with fresh water by a thin 20 meter hose
that leads from lavatory to exhibition room. <i>Plastic Lunge</i> always breathes, emptying one plastic bag and filling the other and letting the process reverse in between individual breaths. 
Its breathing tempo is influenced by the frequency of the visitors' movements on <i>Olympic Strampler</i> though, linking control abilities with perpetual motion. <br/>
The two pen plottings, <i>Kitchen Dweller</i> and <i>Error Space</i> are only thematically related to the rest of the exhibition, exploring misuse of the pen-plotter by effectively humanising it (<i>Kitchen Dweller</i>) 
and time cosumingly plotting over 48000 points generated by a programming error, destroying the medium in the way (<i>Error Space</i>).
