<i>Error Space</i>, a 122cm x 86cm pen plotting, was originally an attempt to render a digital drawing of an imaginary suspended roof in reminiscence of Frei Ottos roof of the 1972 Munich Olympic Arena.
While transforming the shadows into plotter-friendly dots, an error in the rendering code resulted in a vector drawing with about 48000 points.
Making a pen-plotter plot 48000 dots takes about 72 hours and 4 Pilot G-Tec C4 gel pens. It also rips the medium apart in the areas of the highest point concentration and creates a rough texture in their surroundings which makes the time that went into the process tangible. 
Listening to the plotter place dot after dot reminds me of the machine in Franz Kafka's "In der Strafkolonie".
